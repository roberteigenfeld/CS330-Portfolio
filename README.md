# CS330-Portfolio

When I design software, I start by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts and focusing on what the user needs. I aim to keep the design clear, scalable, and easy to test. As I work, I refine the design based on feedback. This project taught me how to design modular components and use prototyping to balance functionality with a clean look, especially when building 3D environments. I used an iterative approach, starting with simple sketches and prototypes, then testing and improving the design step by step. Breaking problems down and refining as I go are strategies I’ll definitely use in future projects because they make the process smoother and more efficient.

When it comes to development, I begin by understanding the problem, planning out the steps, and coding in smaller parts. I test as I go to make sure everything works and stays organized. For my 3D scene, I focused on building incrementally—starting with the basics, testing often, and adding details one step at a time. Using version control also helped me keep track of changes and fix mistakes. Iterating throughout the process was key; each round of testing and refining helped me improve the quality and performance of the project.

Over time, my approach to coding became more organized and efficient. I learned to write cleaner, modular code and test regularly, which made debugging easier and boosted my confidence. Computer science gives me tools to solve real-world problems, whether through software, data analysis, or design. It’s helping me work toward my goals and make an impact.

Through computational graphics, I learned to approach problems visually and think creatively. These skills will help me in areas like game design, data visualization, and other technical fields as I continue my studies. Professionally, I’ve gained practical experience in problem-solving, design, and precision. Whether I work in animation, game development, or visualization, I now know how to combine creativity with technical skills to deliver strong results.
